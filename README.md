# React + Vite
As an employer searching for qualified candidates with proven expertise in building single-page applications (SPAs), I want the ability to thoroughly review a potential employee's deployed React portfolio, which showcases a curated collection of their work samples, including functional and visually appealing applications, so that I can effectively evaluate their technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail. This portfolio should allow me to assess their proficiency in key technologies, such as React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and any additional tools or libraries relevant to SPA development. Furthermore, the portfolio should demonstrate their ability to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces, manage state effectively, and integrate third-party APIs, ensuring that their work aligns with the practical requirements of our open position. By evaluating the quality, functionality, and scope of their projects, I can make informed hiring decisions and identify candidates who not only meet technical qualifications but also exhibit creativity, professionalism, and a strong commitment to delivering high-quality work.
